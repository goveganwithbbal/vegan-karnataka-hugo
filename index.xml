      <title>Are Your Beliefs Really Your Own</title>

      <description>Over four years ago, I decided to turn vegan. Now before you feel irked by the negative connotations memes have made you associate the word &amp;ldquo;vegan&amp;rdquo; with, give me a chance to explain. I&amp;rsquo;m not writing to tell you that you should go vegan because some vegan said it&amp;rsquo;s wrong to kill animals but I&amp;rsquo;d like a chance to help you challenge yourself. Why? Because before society conditioned you into believing that animals are commodities and desensitised you from their plight, in all probability, you yourself believed that it&amp;rsquo;s wrong to kill animals.</description>

      <description>But plants have feelings. They feel pain. Granted that plants are living beings, but research hasn&amp;rsquo;t established sentience in plants. They may react to chemical stimuli and vibrations, but not in the conscious way that animals do. What has been established by scientific research, however, is the fact that non-human animals are sentient beings. If we were to truly think about it: no one would consider cutting a carrot to be on par with slitting the throat of an animal.</description>

      <title>Our Animal Friends From the Movies</title>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re already rooting for the animals when you watch these movies.
It&amp;rsquo;s about time you started rooting for the animals in real life too!
Madagascar (2006)
Marty: Just imagine going back to nature. Back to your roots, clean air, wide open spaces! Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it bother you guys that you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about life outside of this zoo?
Babe (1995)
Ferdinand: Look, there&amp;rsquo;s something you should know.
Babe: Yes?
Ferdinand: Humans eat ducks!</description>

      <title>Should You Be Okay With Someones Choice to Oppress</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not homophobic, but it&amp;rsquo;s okay if you are.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I believe that women should have equal rights, but it&amp;rsquo;s okay if you don&amp;rsquo;t think so.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I would never kill anybody, but it&amp;rsquo;s okay if you want to.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I would never rape anybody, but it&amp;rsquo;s okay if you wish to.&amp;rdquo;
Sounds absurd right?
When you tell a vegan, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s alright if you&amp;rsquo;re vegan, but you should also be okay with others wanting to be non-vegan&amp;rdquo;; you are quite simply saying:</description>

      <title>You Are What You Do</title>

      <description>If you believe in bodily autonomy/&amp;ldquo;my body, my choice&amp;rdquo;, grant animals the same.
If you believe in the need for agency, allow animals to have that same agency.
If you believe in rights over your own reproductive capacity, give animals the same rights.
If you are against objectification, stop participating in the objectification of animals for your pleasure.
If you know that pleasure doesn&amp;rsquo;t justify exploitation, stop using the pleasure you derive from animal products as a justification to continue exploiting animals.</description>

      <title>What Our Reporting of Human Oppression Should Tell Us</title>

      <description>Statements I&amp;rsquo;ve heard which are meant to convey the horrific nature of oppression of humans:
It was terrible! They were treated like an animal. Leather made from human skin? Can you believe it? They treated her like a piece of meat. Studies are being conducted on rural people in developing countries as if they are lab rats. They&amp;rsquo;re literally making them the human guinea pigs. That school bus is so crowded.</description>
