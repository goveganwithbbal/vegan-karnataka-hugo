## Street Outreach

We hold laptops and posters that show what animals are subjected to in different industries, and we have discussions with the interested bystanders about Veganism.  We also hand out cards with resources on Veganism after our conversations.

## BBAL Media and Posters Group

We have a group that ideates and executes the content creation for our social media handles.  The content includes short videos, reels, and posters with informative content that can be shared with non-vegan friends, family, and acquaintances.  Additionally, all promotional content for activism events is created by this group of activists.

If you are good at writing, design, poster making, photoshop, and think you can help spread awareness through this method, feel free to get in touch!

## Wall Paintings

Wall paintings are an inexpensive way of putting up a message on Veganism that stays long after we are done painting.  We select a place that has good footfall, and we even converse with the interested bystanders about Veganism while we are painting.  We have painted a total of 8 walls thus far.

## Talks on Veganism

BBAL activists have conducted talks on Veganism at schools and colleges.  They have also given a talk at one corporate office.  If you would like to get involved in giving lectures, feel free to reach out.

Additionally, it would be great if you could reach out to your school/college or your Alma Mater and help us get a slot for a talk there.

## Chalktivism

We have done several chalk activism campaigns and usually club this with our street outreaches.  The chalk messages stay on the roads long after we leave the spot, and this helps us reach out to a lot of people.

We have also observed that many people stop when they see us writing messages with chalk.  They try to read what we have written and even ask us what we are doing.  This is a great conversation starter.

## Activist Meets

We have conducted two offline meetings for activists to connect, share their thoughts on activism, and become aware of ongoing campaigns such that they may participate/organise.  We have also had virtual activist meets during the lockdown and will continue to have more connects (both offline and online) in the future.

## Rescues

Activists from BBAL have rescued hens, goats, sheep, dogs, pigeons, cats, a buffalo, a rat, and a kite.
