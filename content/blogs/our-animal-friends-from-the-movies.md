You're already rooting for the animals when you watch these movies.  
It's about time you started rooting for the animals in real life too!

**_Madagascar (2006)_**

Marty: Just imagine going back to nature. Back to your roots, clean air, wide open spaces! Doesn't it bother you guys that you don't know anything about life outside of this zoo?

**_Babe (1995)_**

Ferdinand: Look, there's something you should know.  
Babe: Yes?  
Ferdinand: Humans eat ducks!  
Babe: [Gasps] I beg your pardon?  
Ferdinand: Ah, most ducks prefer to forget it, but the fact is that humans like to eat plump, attractive ducks.  
Babe: Oh, I don't think so. Not the Boss, not the Boss' wife.  
Ferdinand: No sooner do I become indispensable than they bring in a machine to do the job.

Cat: Well, they say that you've forgotten that you're a pig. And they even said that you don't know what pigs are for.  
Babe: What do you mean, 'what pigs are for'?  
Cat: You know, why pigs are here.  
Babe: Why are any of us here?  
Cat: Well, the cow's here to be milked, the dogs are here to help the Boss' husband with the sheep, and I'm here to be beautiful and affectionate to the Boss.  
The fact is that pigs don't have a purpose. Just like ducks don't have a purpose.  
Babe: [confused] Uh, I â€“ I don't, uh...  
Cat: All right, for your own sake, I'll be blunt. Why do the Bosses keep ducks? To eat them. So why do the Bosses keep a pig?  
Babe: They... eat pigs?  
Cat: Pork, they call it. Or bacon. They only call them pigs when they're alive.

**_Chicken Run (2000)_**

Ginger: So, laying eggs all your life, then getting plucked and roasted is good enough for you?

---

Ginger: We lay eggs, day in and day out, and when we can't lay any more, they kill us.

---

Ginger: They're fattening us up. They're going to kill us all!

---

Babs: I don't want to be a chicken pie.

---

Ginger: I imagine what it must be like on the other side. I've - I've never actually felt grass beneath my feet.

**_Free Birds (2013)_**

"A time to sit down over the holiday meal. It's everyone's favourite part. Unless of course, you are the meal. My name is Reggie, by the way. I'm the turkey screaming for his life. Thanksgiving is a turkey's worst nightmare."

---

"That's our mission. Not to save ten turkeys or even a hundred, but all of them. We're going back in time to the first Thanksgiving to get turkeys off the menu."

_101 Dalmatians (1996)_, _Bee Movie (2007)_, _Bambi (1942)_, _Finding Nemo (2003)_, _Lady and the Tramp (1955)_, _Black Beauty_, _Charlotte's Web (2006)_, _Rio (2011)_, _Duma (2005)_, _Fly Away Home (1996)_, _Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron (2002)_, _Free Willy (1993)_, _Paulie and The Plague Dogs (1982)_ are a few other movies dealing with issues that have you rooting for the animals.

Don't be the humans you hate while watching these films.  
Be the change. Be vegan.
