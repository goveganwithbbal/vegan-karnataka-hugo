"I'm not homophobic, but it's okay if you are."

"I believe that women should have equal rights, but it's okay if you don't think so."

"I would never kill anybody, but it's okay if you want to."

"I would never rape anybody, but it's okay if you wish to."

**Sounds absurd right?**

When you tell a vegan, "It's alright if you're vegan, but you should also be okay with others wanting to be non-vegan"; you are quite simply saying:  
"Be happy that you're _NOT_ the reason animals are being massacred all over the world, but you should also be okay with others wanting to continue being the reason that _THEY ARE_."

Stop asking vegans to respect your decision to knowingly continue being the reason that animals are bred, enslaved, abused, tortured, and slaughtered.
