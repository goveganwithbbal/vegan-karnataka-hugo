If you believe in bodily autonomy/"my body, my choice", grant animals the same.

If you believe in the need for agency, allow animals to have that same agency.

If you believe in rights over your own reproductive capacity, give animals the same rights.

If you are against objectification, stop participating in the objectification of animals for your pleasure.

If you know that pleasure doesn't justify exploitation, stop using the pleasure you derive from animal products as a justification to continue exploiting animals.

If you hope for peace on earth, stop participating in the violence inflicted on animals on a daily basis.

If you want justice and equality for all, stop denying it to animals.

It's ridiculous to fight for these rights for all when your actions on a daily basis are in constant violation of the very things you claim to believe in and fight for.

If anyone reading this is thinking, "You can't compare the two. It's different for animals. They're just animals", please know that THAT is the very same mind-set behind all oppression â€“ the idea that those who are 'different' can be exploited, abused and oppressed because they are DIFFERENT which in some twisted world is somehow supposed to mean INFERIOR.

So if you're thinking that, please apply the following statement to other social justice movements and see if it justifies the oppression:
This is different. They are different.
