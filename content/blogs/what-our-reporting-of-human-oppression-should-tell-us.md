Statements I've heard which are meant to convey the horrific nature of oppression of humans:

1. It was terrible! They were _treated like an animal_.
2. Leather made from _human skin_? Can you believe it?
3. They treated her like a _piece of meat_.
4. Studies are being conducted on rural people in developing countries as if _they are lab rats_. They're literally making them the _human guinea pigs_.
5. That school bus is so crowded. That many kids in one small bus being _transported like cattle/like chickens_.
6. They worked him _like an ox_.
7. All the students were locked inside for Sports Day like _animals in a zoo_.
8. They made him perform for their sick pleasure like some _circus animal_.
9. _Human circuses_? Can you imagine being put on show your whole life for someone's idea of entertainment?
10. It's a _dog's life_.
11. You've been raising him like a _pig for slaughter_.
12. Squealed _like a pig_.
13. Bleeding like a _stuck pig_.
14. The person was powerless, like a _lamb to the slaughter_.
15. Their bodies were piled up like _animal carcasses_.
16. Trembling like a _cornered animal_.

Since majority of humans understand why these things are wrong when humans are the victims, it's about time we started recognising why it's wrong for animals to be in that position in the first place.
