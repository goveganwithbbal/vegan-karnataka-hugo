1.  **But plants have feelings.  They feel pain.**

Granted that plants are living beings, but research hasn't established sentience in plants.  They may react to chemical stimuli and vibrations, but not in the conscious way that animals do.  What has been established by scientific research, however, is the fact that non-human animals are sentient beings.  If we were to truly think about it: no one would consider cutting a carrot to be on par with slitting the throat of an animal.  There's a reason people flinch when watching videos of animals being killed.  There's a reason such content requires trigger warnings.  The same simply isn't true for videos of vegetables being cut because people don't truly believe both acts are the same.

However, even if we were to assume that plants do actually feel pain, going vegan would still be the sensible thing to do.  Most crops grown today are fed to animals raised for food.  Forest areas are being cleared for animal agriculture.  By this logic, we're actually "killing" far more plants to sustain non-vegan lifestyles than we would be to sustain a vegan lifestyle.  We can reduce the numbers drastically by relying directly on the plants when we adopt a vegan lifestyle.

*Cowspiracy* (available on Netflix) is an informative documentary to watch to learn more about the impact of animal agriculture on the planet.

2.  **What about the Touch Me Not plant (*Mimosa Pudica*) and carnivorous plants?**

Unlike animals, the mechanism of movement of the Touch Me Not plant is not a muscular movement, but osmotic movement.  This movement is observed in many plant species, but they respond to light.  The Touch Me Not plant responds to light as well as touch.  Such a response is called Thigmonasty (Thigmo means touch).  Whenever there is an external disturbance, it causes a mechanical/physical change in the leaves.  This mechanical/physical disturbance releases Potassium into the plant's water channels.  This instantly reduces the internal pressure that keeps the leaves open.  Hence, we see the leaves fold inwards.

A similar mechanism is observed in carnivorous plants.  Plants generally rely on bacteria in the soil for their nitrogen intake.  Some soils however, don't support the nitrogen fixing bacteria so evolution has resulted in plants in such soils relying on insects to meet their nitrogen requirement.  There is no consciousness or neural involvement in the movement of these plants.  It is only a physical and chemical mechanism.

3.  **Where do you get your protein?**

It's important to realise that humans need protein, not meat in their diets and protein can be found in plant-based sources.  Proteins are the building blocks of DNA and engines of intra-cellular metabolism.  All plants are made up of water, proteins, carbohydrates, fatty-acids, minerals, and vitamins.  It's possible to meet the body's daily requirement for protein (and other nutrients) on a plant-based diet.  Below is a list of some plant-based sources of protein many of us already consume.

For an average person (not bodybuilding), the daily protein intake should be about 0.8 grams per kg of body weight which can easily be met through a plant-based diet.  Even professional athletes and bodybuilders can meet their daily protein requirement on a plant-based diet.  It's possible not just to survive, but thrive on a plant-based diet.  In fact, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the largest global organization of nutrition professionals has declared a plant-based diet to be appropriate for all stages of life, including pregnancy.

To know more about the health aspect, we'd recommend watching *What the Health*.  Another great documentary that features professional vegan athletes and bodybuilders is *The Game Changers*.  Both are available on Netflix.

4.  **But we have canine teeth.**

We have flat and blunt teeth, much like that of other herbivores.  The canine teeth of rhinos, hippos, saber tooth deer, and other herbivorous animals are much larger and sharper, but that doesn't mean they're meant for meat eating.  In fact, hippos have the largest canine teeth among all land mammals in the animal kingdom, but they're herbivores.  Our canine teeth can hardly do the job of ripping through the flesh of a living animal.  They're more suited for biting into fruits like apples and pears.

Let's assume that our canine teeth were capable of ripping through flesh in the same way that lions and tigers can.  The vegans in the world today are proof of the fact that we can live healthy and happy lives without eating animal products.  Under such circumstances, is having a mere body part capable of inflicting harm a good enough reason to inflict harm?  Even if our canine teeth were meant for ripping flesh, it's possible to thrive without consuming animal products and that should be a good enough reason to make the switch.

5.  **Tigers and lions eat meat.**

Yes, tigers and lions are obligate carnivores which means they cannot survive on plants.  But, humans can survive on a plant-based diet.  There are several behaviors that these animals exhibit that we don't draw a comparison with.  We don't live like them, mate like them, raise our young like them, or greet each other the way they do.  Then, why do we draw a comparison with lions and tigers only when it comes to meat eating?

If we were to actually draw comparisons with other species, it would make more sense for us to draw comparisons with our closest relatives from the animal kingdom: apes.  Their diet consists mostly of plants so why look to lions and tigers for a comparison?  The behaviors of these animals shouldn't be the moral baseline we use to determine our own behaviors.  We don't need meat to survive the way that these animals do, so we can't justify our meat eating based on the fact that lions and tigers eat meat.

6.  **But if we don't consume animals, they will take over the world!**

These animals only exist in such large numbers because we demand their bodies for consumption.  To give an example, a hen would naturally lay just 10 to 15 eggs a year, but they've been bred to lay around 350 eggs a year to meet the rising demand of consumers.  The system functions on the basis of demand and supply.  The more we demand, the more producers will supply.  The world isn't going to go vegan overnight (as much as we would love for it to).  As more people turn vegan, lesser animals are going to be bred into the world, so there's no need to worry about animals taking over the world.

Also, it's important to be real with ourselves.  We don't consume animals in an effort to keep their population in check (which isn't up to us to do either way).  We consume animals out of habit, tradition, culture, or because we enjoy the way they taste.  Let's not assign any sense of this being a "noble" act we're doing.

7.  **But Hitler was a vegetarian.**

This is actually a lie.  Hitler was a non-vegetarian.  Two of his biographers, Albert Speer and Robert Payne spoke about Hitler's love for liver dumplings, ham, and game (hunted birds).  Hitler's main chef, Deon Lucas, wrote a book titled '*Gourmet Cooking School Cookbook*' in 1964 in which she mentions Hitler's favorite recipes, especially stuffed squab, his favorite dish.  According to Robert Payne, Joseph Goebbels was responsible for Hitler's vegetarianism propaganda.  This was done in an effort to make Hitler appear to be more like MK Gandhi at the time.

But, even if we were to assume that Hitler was a vegetarian, how would that justify meat eating and what bearing does that have on a vegan?  Several other murderous, tyrannical dictators like Joseph Stalin, Mao, Idi Amin, and others were meat eaters.  If we're going to use "Hitler's vegetarianism" as a reason not to turn vegan, we might as well use the example of several meat eating dictators as reasons to stop eating meat.

8.  **Humans are carnivores/omnivores.**

Humans can survive on both meat (when cooked) and vegetables.  However, humans are closer to herbivores than carnivores.  Our digestive systems more closely resemble that of grass-eating animals both physiologically and anatomically.  The human intestine is longer than that of carnivores.  The short intestine of carnivores allows animal flesh to pass through more quickly so that the arteries of these animals don't get clogged.  Human saliva also contains carbohydrate digestive enzymes, something common in other herbivorous animals.

If we observe the jaw motion of carnivores when they are eating, the jaw moves in a vertical (tearing and swallowing) motion.  If we observe the jaw motion of herbivores when they are eating, the jaw moves in a horizontal (grinding and swallowing) motion.  If we observe the jaw motion of humans, we'd realise that we eat in a grinding motion, like other herbivores.

We also sweat through our pores to cool down instead of panting like carnivorous animals.  Another important point to note is that unlike carnivores, we don't salivate at the sight and smell of blood.  We pick and choose which parts of the animal to eat and which parts to discard, something real carnivores don't do.

The vegans of the world today are living proof that we can thrive without animal products and therefore, we should.

9.  **Eating animals made our brain grow or eating cooked animals made our brain grow.**

It is not specifically eating animals or cooking animal flesh that made our brain grow, it was the process of cooking that helped our brain grow ie, cooking everything, vegetables and all.  When humans discovered fire and cooking, it gave us an evolutionary advantage.  When we consume our foods raw, it takes lot of time to chew and digest, whereas when we consume cooked food, it is easy for our mouths to chew and easy for our stomachs to digest.  Cooking helped us to conserve energy that would otherwise go into chewing and digesting raw foods.  The energy conserved is believed to have been diverted to the brain and this boosted our brain's development.

Glucose is the main sources of energy for the brain, which come from starches and sugars which are found in plant-based foods.  Animal-based foods are mostly protein and fats which are not the preferred energy source for our brain.  As well as, now we also know that even when humans were eating animals, we predominantly ate plant-based foods.

Regardless of these facts through, the reality we live in today is very different.  We have an abundance of plant-based products available in the market today to choose from.  The actions of our ancestors shouldn't be the baseline we pick for determining our behaviours today.  People can thrive on a plant-based diet and the options available today make it possible for them to make the change easily.

10.  **But humans are on top of the food-chain/eco-system.**

Yes, when it comes to intelligence and efficiency, we are on top on the evolutionary scale.  However, it is often misunderstood that we are top of food-chain.  To be on top of the food-chain, we have to be an obligate carnivore in the first place.  According to an article published in the PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America), ecologists ranked species by their diets using a metric called the trophic level.  Plants, which produce their own food, are given a rank of 1.  Herbivores, which eat only plants, are ranked 2, whereas the fiercest of meat-eating predators are ranked at 5.5.  According to this study, humans are ranked at 2.2, which is closer to a herbivore than a carnivore.

Having said that, even if we were to believe that we're on top of the food-chain, how would that justify what we currently do to animals?  We can live healthy lives without relying on animal products.  Killing animals when we don't need them to survive and using the food-chain to justify it is a "might makes right" argument.

Also, the food-chain operates as per the laws of nature.  Nothing about the way we raise animals and kill them today is natural.  In fact, we're disturbing the natural balance in the environment by our current meat eating practices.

11.  **But if we stop eating animals, we go weak.  We lose our masculinity.**

This is a common misconception created by years of being taught that we need animal products to survive.  We don't need animal products to be healthy.  We need to ensure we have a balanced-diet and meet our nutritional requirements.  If we don't pay attention to what we're eating, we can fall sick (this is true regardless of whether we're eating animals or plant-based foods).  With regard to masculinity, again, years of conditioning have linked the idea of masculinity with meat eating.  There is nothing masculine about killing innocent beings and we need to be conscious about just how much we have been conditioned to view meat eating as masculine.  '*The Sexual Politics of Meat*' by Carol J. Adams is a good book to read for more information on this.

In fact, diet and lifestyle have been linked to some of the leading causes of death in meat eating populations.  Plant-based diets have been found to be helpful in the treatment and even reversal of some of the leading causes of death, including heart diseases.

The unhygienic conditions that animals are raised in along with the excessive antibiotics used has even led to the spread of zoonotic diseases.  This poses a risk to human health as well.

12.  **But what about the taste of milk?  I like its taste and I cannot live without milk.**

It's important to understand that most people who are vegan today didn't turn vegan because they suddenly stopped enjoying the taste of animal products.  They're vegan because they realised that they could do something to put a stop to the unnecessary violence inflicted on animals for their daily choices.  Humans are the only species that continue to drink milk beyond infancy and we're also the only species that drink the milk of another species.  Wouldn't it be weird to drink the milk of a dog, cat, or horse?  The only individual in need of a cow's milk is her calf.

We've become accustomed to the taste of milk because we've been consuming milk and milk-based products for several years.  Changing any habit may seem difficult at first, but it's possible.  There are so many alternatives to milk and milk-based products in the market today that we don't have to feel like we're missing out.  We can even meet our calcium requirements from whole plant-based foods without necessarily having to rely on alternatives.

The taste pleasure we derive from a product cannot be used to justify the violence inflicted on an animal to obtain the product.

13.  **These things do not happen to the cows in my village.**

Veganism seeks to abolish the commodity status of animals.  Whether it's a small farm in a village or a large factory farm, the reality is, the animals are still looked at as money-making machines.  The procedures may differ in villages, but males calves are still sold for slaughter; females are still denied the milk of their mothers; and cows are still sent to be slaughtered when their milk production drops.  They still only serve as money-making machines, so cows in small villages don't really have it any better.  Our aim should be to eliminate animal exploitation, not find ways to continue exploiting animals to a lesser degree.

14.  **What about the farmers in rural villages whose livelihood depends solely on cows?**

Again, as much as we would like for the world to go vegan tonight, this isn't going to happen.  The market functions on the basis of demand and supply.  As more people stop consuming animal products and switch to plant-based foods, farmers will have the opportunity to explore alternative sources of income like crop farming.  This change is going to be a gradual one and farmers will have time to adapt to the market demand.

It's also important to note here that several professions generate income for households.  Slavery once generated income for plantation owners.  No one would argue for its continuance simply because it would put plantation owners out of work.

15.  **If it is such a slow process, why should I change?  Just by changing myself, I will not bring any big change to the nation/world.**

Many times change or transition is slow indeed.  But you have to understand that everything has a beginning and everything starts with one.  If Gandhi, Ambedkar, Martin Luther King, Jr, Swami Vivekananda, Abdul Kalam (name anyone you like) would have thought along these lines, that if change is going to be slow why bother, our society would have experienced a completely different history.  Perhaps a history we would likely not desire.

What we need is faith & confidence in our moral actions–that we only want to better the lives of those around us.  With this in mind, we can take the first step and others will eventually follow.  I have taken mine, you too should consider taking your first step.

In the past, we didn't have any readily available packaged soy, rice, cashew, or oat milk.  But now every major retail store has plant-based milk options available.  Similarly, as the demands change more and more vegan foods will be available.

Adding to this, many vegan businesses are coming up as we the consumers change our demands. 
Change is happening right now around us – and you can be an active participant in this change.

16.  **What will happen to the cows if we stop consuming milk?  This is why I cannot stop consuming milk.**

First of all this is a slow process (please refer Question 14, 2nd paragraph).  Secondly, after watching the videos of the dairy industry, by now you clearly know the fate of cows.  The victims of the dairy industry are abandoned or slaughtered anyway once they stop giving us high volumes of their milk.

So, if you continue purchasing milk products for the sake of saving the cows, you are indirectly/unwillingly choosing the fate of their death as well.  You are both trying to save the animal and also setting their death.  As the demand for animal dairy products will decrease due to conscious consumers, the businesses will have to look elsewhere like plant-based dairy alternatives and so, the production of animal milk and subsequent animal exploitation will go down.  Lesser and lesser number of cows will be bred, exploited, sold, and slaughtered by the animal dairy industry and therefore, the suffering of these animals can be reduced.  There is never going to be a situation where all the animals kept captive by the dairy industry will find themselves abandoned with no one to genuinely take care of them since this progress of the society transitioning away from animal products is a slow with ample time for industries, farmers and animal caretakers to adapt.

17.  **Cows and goats I can agree, but I still don't care about chickens.**

It is understandable why we don't think of chickens worthy of our acceptance or deserve attention as much as dogs, cats, cows, goats do.  It is only because we are not emotionally connected to a chicken or a fish as much as we are connected to more relatable mammals like humans, dogs, cows, cats, et cetera.

The society we grew up in was in such a condition that the moment we utter the word chicken, most of them think about meat and food, barely anyone thinks about how beautiful a bird a chicken is.  Chickens can recognise people, count numbers, take care of their babies, remember faces & their flock, et cetera and yet we make them suffer throughout their lives and then kill them by the billions.

Painful facts to know about Chickens/hens farms:

{Inform the audience in an interactive way}

There are two breeds of Chickens, one that lays eggs called Layers and the ones that are raised for meat, known as Broilers.

{Ask the listener}

I will ask you few questions, please speak up if you know the answer.

a) Can anyone tell me how long does a normal chicken in the wild would live up to?

b) Now, can anyone tell me how many eggs does a normal Chicken in the wild would produce per year?

c) Could you guess the maximum survival age of a Chicken from an egg farm (layer) and how many eggs does a layer lay per year in an egg farm?

d) Could you tell me the maximum survival age of a Chicken from the farms that are raised for meat (broilers)?

Ans:

a) 8-12 years

b) 12 eggs per year

c) 2 years.  Around 300 eggs.

Biologically speaking, eggs are Chicken's menstrual cycle.  Imagine the physical stress they undergo to produce such a huge number of eggs.  [How does it feel for a woman to go 300 menstrual cycles/year] No chicken will survive beyond two years due to the unimaginable stress they undergo.  [Explain what happens to the male chicks of a layer soon after they were born: Males are instantly killed in mechanical grinders et cetera.  as they are not considered useful both as a layer and as a broiler; whereas female chicks are forced to follow their mother's path and the cycle repeats]

d) 45-60 days.  All the Chickens we see and consume, from the street side slaughterhouse to the big brands like KFC, McDonald's, Burger Kings, et cetera all this meat come from Chickens that are less that two-months old.  Which is roughly equivalent to a one-year old human baby.  It is possible to for a chicken to grow rapidly in less than two months due to hormones.

18.  **It is fine as long as we kill them humanely.**

Before we use these terms, it is worth looking a bit deeper into what it means to take away a being's independence, autonomy, life, and what being humane signifies.

A sentient being, human or non-human, is meant to be free and have autonomy over their own bodies.  This is far from the reality of the animal farming industry.  The lives of these beings are controlled and dictated from the moment they're born to their death by humans alone.  These animals are not shown humanity but are certainly shown the darkest sides of humanity.

Doing something humanely implies doing it with the intention of caring, being kind, and compassionate towards the recipient being.  No animal would desire to give up their entire lives to satisfy the human species.  You take away their life forcefully.  We may use different methods, we may call it differently, euphemise it, but the fact remains: animals do not want their lives and deaths dictated by humans.

Animals are not ours to use, commodify, eat, or wear.  They have their own family, freedom and their own way of living.  They exist with us, not for us.

Also, if I may ask, "What quality do animals lack, which is present in humans and that makes us special?"

Anatomy?  Physiology?  Intelligence?  Compassion?

But name any, each species has its own unique quality, each has its own place and value.  They are not to be compared or pitted against one another to find a superior trait or quality.  Some fly, some crawl, some swim, some see in the dark and the list goes on.  We cannot assume superiority and take pride in it just because we can use our intelligence and brute force to control and enslave animals.

19.  **What about mosquitoes, cockroaches, fleas, food pests, et cetera.?**

Being vegan is about doing the least harm to other beings as possible.

While in certain cases insects can be simply released back into the wild away from our homes without killing them or repellants be used, some insect deaths and pest control are unavoidable.  If an insect is destroying food, damaging your home or resources it is justified to control or remove them.

To unnecessarily go around killing insects for fun is wrong, but tackling them when they are impacting our lives negatively is okay.

If the insect bites us, spreads deadly infections, is a health concern et cetera, it is okay to take preventative steps and measures as and when required.

20.  **What is vegan?**

A vegan is a person who does not consume anything that comes from animals (No meat, fish, prawns, eggs, honey, et cetera); and also do not consume any dairy products (No milk, buttermilk, cheese, panner, et cetera) in addition to it, vegans don't use any animal products (No leather, silk, wool, fur, et cetera) neither on his/her body nor as furniture or decoration; vegans also will not entertain nor participate and promote any form animal abuse for amusement (No zoos, circus, sports, et cetera) and in research purposes (No laboratory experiments).

Vegetarianism is a dietary practice, whereas veganism is moral position and philosophy that recognises non-human animals as individuals who exist alongside humans and not for humans.  Veganism is not just a dietary lifestyle, but also an ethical position against the exploitation of animals in any possible or imaginable way (food, clothing, decoration, entertainment, experimentation, et cetera.)

21.  **Isn't that (vegan) unhealthy?**

It is a common misconception that when we stop consuming animal products, people go unhealthy or nutritionally deficient.  However, this is not true.  As a matter of fact, people will become healthy.  On a vegan diet, we are removing the potentially harmful components from a typical animal-based diet such as certain carcinogens, cholesterols, heavy metals, unnecessary pesticides, et cetera.

PS: It is important to know that junk food is found in a vegan diet as well.  For example: Coca-Cola is vegan, but it is unhealthy for the body.

22.  **Being vegan is very expensive!**

That cannot be true.  A vegan lifestyle is for everybody.  People often think only celebrities, urbanites and rich people can go vegan only because they can afford it.  If we do examine our purchase choices, anyone will realise that it won't cost any more than a non-vegan diet, perhaps even less.

For example:

+ Instead of butter dosa or butter naan or cheese items, you can save money by asking for plain dosa, plain naan, et cetera, also as an added advantage/bonus, it improves your health too.
+ Whichever restaurant you go to, non-vegetarian foods are placed at higher prices than vegetarian dishes.
+ Soy milk costs little more than regular cow milk, but the difference is not very significant.  As an added benefit, you may improve your health by cutting out animal dairy.

In the long run, a vegan lifestyle will always save money, health and the environment.

23.  **What do you eat? (or) If we take away meat and dairy, what is left to eat?**

Rice, Wheat, Corn, Pulses, Cereals, legumes, Oats, barley, walnuts, groundnuts, cashew, almonds, dosa, vada, upma, dal, sabzi, kheer, cakes, pulao, noodles, bread, et cetera.  The list goes on.  There is no lack of vegan options, and more alternatives keep popping up all the time.  Besides, many traditional Indian dishes are vegan if we, for example: avoid butter or cheese as a garnish in many North-Indian dishes.  Or drink vegan buttermilk instead of cow buttermilk, et cetera.

24.  **Agriculture kills animals too (or) If vegans love animals, why do they eat their food?**

Plant-based agricultural practices kill far fewer animals than the animal industry.  The majority of the deforestation along with loss of habitat of endangered species is happening around the world due to high demand for raise in crops that can be fed to the animals and in turn, the animals fed to humans.  Just by switching to a plant-based or vegan diet, we can stop deforestation and also save the animals from extinction.
Click here to see a short video on the environmental impact of animal agriculture.
The idea of veganism is to understand life as it is, and to live in a 'least violent way' possible, so that we may cause the least amount of suffering to life.

25.  **What if I get stranded in a desert or on a remote island or lost in a jungle?**

That cannot happen because it is mostly an imaginary concern.  At the moment, we are not stranded in a desert with nothing to eat.  We have plenty of options and choices available to us.

Even if such a situation ever happens, we can act as per the situation.  But for now, we should be more concerned about the current situation and the reality.

26.  **You are not saving any being by not eating meat, the animals are going to be slaughtered anyway so what’s the use?**

You demand, they supply.

You demand more, they supply more.

You stop demanding, they stop supplying.  Every drop counts.

As an individual, it is immensely important that we have to stop looking at ourselves as insignificant or incapable; and should start taking up individual responsibility.  As long as we look up to the society to change and yet, we don’t apply the change at our individual level, no big changes will ever occur.  After all, we ourselves are part of and participants of society.

As long as we purchase animal products, we are personally lending this exploitative animal industry our support and money to continue their business of animal exploitation.

Also see Question 15.

27.  **Eventually, we all die anyway, so why should I care?**

True.  Everything that has a beginning sure has an end.  But just because it has an end does not mean that whatever brief moment it has left between birth and death, should be taken for granted.  The same applies to you too.

Just because you know that you have taken birth and are surely aware that you are going to die someday anyway; it does not stop you from seeking to have a good day today.  So why should we take away from the animals who have similar desires and a will to live their lives free from human control?

28.  **Even vegetables are adulterated these days.**

True.  We are aware of this fact.  However, have you heard the word bio-accumulation?  It refers to the accumulation of harmful substances and toxins like chemicals, pesticides, antibiotics, heavy metals, et cetera in the food-chain.

For example, hens have to eat three kgs of unwashed grains (that are flooded with pesticides) to grow into one kg of chicken.  Now all these chemicals contained in three kg of grains are concentrated in one kg of chicken.  When a human eats this chicken, all these concentrated chemicals will be accumulated in our body.  So, you will have enough toxins in your body when eating one kg chicken in four sittings as much as if you eat three kg grains in 20 sittings, the latter is comparatively much safer.  Also, we should not forget the hormones and antibiotics that are added or injected into these animals for quick and disease-free growth.

29.  **I will focus on having organic and cage-free meat (instead of organic plants.)**

Besides the fact that cage-free meat is an absolute lie, we should also know how we were convinced into thinking cage-free meat is good.  If we do a little research, anyone will realise that it is a marketing gimmick to mislead consumers into thinking that they are not harming the environment or animals.  No one knows exactly how these animals were raised, under what conditions and what food has it eaten and from where.  [Organic means nothing to the animals.  They eat anything.]

FREE in the word 'cage-free' does not mean the animals are having freedom.  And 'Free-Range' just means bigger prisons.  Organic or cage-free does not mean the animal is happy.  It is just a word without meaning in reality.  In many cases, organic only means they're not using antibiotics and hormones.  Animals still face a range of abuse and exploitation.  And in the end, you would still be killing the animal that does not want to die for you.

30.  **But Vitamin B12 is very important to growth and plants don't have Vitamin B12!**

Yes Vitamin B12 is very important for healthy growth.  Also known as Cobalamin, Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a key role in various physiological activities like neurons, red blood cells formation and health.  It is primarily stored in the liver and muscles of animals including humans.

However, neither animals nor even plants can manufacture Vitamin B12 on their own, it is present in animals through the work of gut bacteria and/or a process called bio-accumulation (See Question 28).

Unlike most Vitamins, Vitamin B12 is not produced by animals.  It is made by certain bacteria present in soil and their gut bacteria.  Most animals get their Vitamin B12 from grazing lands by eating the dirt off along with grass.  Ruminants acquire vitamin B12, which is considered an essential nutrient, through a symbiotic relationship with the bacteria present in their stomachs.  In aquatic environments, most phytoplankton acquire Vitamin B12 through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria, and they become food for other aquatic animals.

Some animals get their Vitamin B12 by consuming their own faeces (like rabbits, dogs, et cetera.)  Even humans have bacteria that can produce Vitamin B12, but these bacteria are present mostly in the large intestine where the absorption into the body does not take place. Hence, this is excreted as faeces.

Besides, B12 deficiency is common in meat eaters as well – since they bank on the animals they're eating to have enough Vitamin B12 in their bodies.

Also, similar to salts that are fortified with Iodine, many of the foods available today are fortified with Vitamin B12.  We can also get the supplements from various sources like Vitamin B12 fortified nutritional yeast, fortified vegan milk, or just plain Vitamin B12 tablets. 
B12 tablets are the safest, most reliable and cheapest source of B12.  For an entire month, they cost about INR 30.  When going for B12 tablets/supplements, try to opt for cyanocobalamin over methylcobalamin.

So, if we just understand and learn how to eat and what to eat, we can overcome these concerns of deficiencies and live healthily.
